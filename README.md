# YTViewers

This application uses the yt_stats.py by python-engineer (https://github.com/python-engineer/youtube-analyzer) to get a stream's concurrent users using the Youtube API.

When ran a window will pop up (in the centre of the screeen) asking for the video Id of the current stream. Enter a valid video id. Once submitted, the window will refresh, 
reallocate to the top rigth hand corner and display the concurrent viewers of the stream itself.

WHATS USED:
- JSON requests
- Youtube API
- Tkinter
